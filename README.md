## Welcome to the RillRate Organization!

**RillRate Stack** is the real-time dashboard engine that
lets you quickly develop and embed a live web dashboard
into your applications and get fast UI with excellent benefits:

- It’s more powerful than terminal UI
- It’s more flexible than native UI
- It’s cheaper than creating your custom dashboard from scratch
- It’s bi-directional in comparison with monitoring dashboards
